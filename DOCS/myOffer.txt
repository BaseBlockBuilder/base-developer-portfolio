I'll deploy simple smart contracts (like a Counter) from your provided wallet on both Base Mainnet and Sepolia.
We’ll verify the contracts on Basescan to make your work publicly visible.

I’ll  perform developer interactions (calls, reads, writes) using Hardhat or Foundry to show active development.

We’ll create a public GitHub repo with the source code and link your wallet address in the README to connect your on-chain and off-chain identities.

Finally, I’ll prepare a detailed report with all transaction links, contract pages, and the GitHub repo so you have clear documentation of your developer activity.
This process will help you build a clear, professional footprint recognized by the Base community.
